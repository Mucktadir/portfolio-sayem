    <h1>Fields of Expertise</h1>
        <div class="one-third shadow">
        <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
        <p>“Front End” typically refers to what you actually see on the website in the browser (and is often called “client-side”). This means that front end developers are responsible for everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders.</p>
    </div>  
    <div class="one-third shadow">
        <h2>Backend Development</h2>
        <p>While the front end is everything the user interacts with directly, “Back End” typically refers to the guts of the application which live on the server (and is often called “server-side”).  The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database.</p>   
    </div>
    <div class="one-third shadow">
        <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
        <p>Full Stack web development is a combination of both the front-end and back-end. “Stack,” means layer in this case. A full-stack web developer has expertise in all layers of a website’s development. This includes, but not limited to: the server, client and hosting.</p>
